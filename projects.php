					<h2 class="heading mb-4"> awareness campaign</h2>
					<p>In 2017, a major environmental awareness campaign was launched in Mutare District,
						 Zimbabwe, to raise awareness of the need for responsible and sustainable mining operations.
						  The campaign was aimed at educating local communities about the environmental risks posed by mining operations
						 and the importance of sustainable management of natural resources. The campaign 
						included a series of public meetings, posters, and television and radio advertisements.</p>
					<p>The campaign was organized by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Environment and Tourism, in partnership
						 with the Mutare District Council and the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (ZELA).
						  It targeted all stakeholders, including local communities, miners, and government officials.
						   The campaign was successful in raising awareness of
						 environmental issues related to mining and in calling for greater action to promote sustainable mining practices.</p>
					<p>The campaign also led to the creation of the Mutare District Mining Task Force, which was tasked with developing and implementing sustainable mining policies. The task force has worked with local communities and miners to ensure that mining operations comply with applicable laws and regulations and that the environment is protected.</p>
					<p>Overall, the 2017 environmental awareness campaign was a success in raising awareness of the need for responsible and sustainable mining operations in Mutare District. The campaign and its follow-up initiatives have been essential in promoting environmental stewardship and sustainable management of the region's natural resources.</p>

					<p>IIn 2019, the people of Mutasa District in Zimbabwe had been living in a state
						 of conflict and unrest for many years, as a result of different factions vying
						  for control of the valuable resources found in the district's mining communities.
						   In an effort to bring peace and stability to the region, 
						a platform for dialogue was created between the different mining communities.</p>
					<p>The platform allowed for all the different voices within the mining communities 
						to be heard, and for people to have a safe space to discuss their differences and concerns.
						 Through a series of meetings and workshops, the members of the mining communities 
						 were able to come together and find common ground, leading to an understanding of each other's perspectives and needs.</p>
					<p>At the same time, the platform also sought to promote sustainable development in the mining communities, by providing access to education, healthcare, and other essential services. These initiatives enabled the people of Mutasa to improve their quality of life, while also ensuring that the resources of the mining communities would be managed in a sustainable way.</p>
					<p>In the years since its creation, the platform for dialogue has brought about much-needed peace and stability to the mining communities of Mutasa District. The people of the mining communities have been able to find common ground and work together to build a better future. This is a testament to the power of dialogue and collaboration in nurturing sustainable peace</p>
